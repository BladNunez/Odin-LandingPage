# Odin-LandingPage

This Small project has me using HTMl and CSS to create a replica of this website down below.
Some tools in this that will be used is FLexbox in CSS to create containers and be able to align my items
in contrast to the webpage below. Fonts and colors will also be used to make the color scheme the same as the image below.
I have added some of my own images and descriptions to make the web page look more realistic in a real world sense.
